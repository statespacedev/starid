in 83 or 84 came something special - 'getting to know' the pdp-10 / dec10 at swt in san marcos texas. southwest texas state university. this was a dec10 that had been 'handed down' by swt's 'big brother' in austin. coming straight from the utaustin 'source', it natually had decwar installed - that calls for a dedicated discussion. 'adventure' was there as well, and other classics.

the everyday environment on vt-52 or vt-100 was tops-10 sos text editor. this was the 'best practice' command line utility for undergrads learning 'programming', which meant fortran - though lisp, pascal, cobol, basic, etc were definitely 'around'. it seems 'c' was at most a distant rumor in that particular environment - unix certainly was - not clear how much awareness of unix there even was. probably comparable with vms awareness.

sos seems to have been the easy / intro alternative to teco. teco definitely had the reputation of being tough, with command lines compared to 'noise'. sos was the choice for newbies at swt - laminated 'sos commands' cards were for sale at the university bookstore.

having a user account on the dec10, and being able to logon to one of the terminals, was the important thing.

title: "simplex, rand, fifties"
---

here's more on links between early digital computing in aerospace (whirlwind, mit instrumentation lab) and economics (rand santa monica). since there were only a handful of computers and coders in the early fifties, it's actually not so surprising, and another puzzle piece fell into place this week. here's a comment from a post back in april.

_covariance matrices, quadratic forms with 'squared units'. the same thing appeared in finance via markowitz portfolio theory at the same time. it would be interesting to know how much contact there was between kalman and markowitz, or whether it was simply an effect of the availability of digital computers and fortran. this also took place only a few years after dantzig and von neumann's work with the simplex algorithm, and it's possible connections can be found between the whole group._

dantzig moved to rand santa monica in 1952 specifically to do the reference implementation of simplex on ibm cpc, 701, 704. it seems probable that most of his work with von neumann was just prior to that, set on the east coast, and focused on less computational concepts such as duality. dantzig was certainly in washington dc working on the seac computer at the national bureau of standards from 1950 to 1952. at that time, laning was creating the fortran prelude 'george' on whirlwind and moving to the mit instrumentation lab to work on missile guidance with battin, where kalman would soon enter the story. 

the numerical challenge for simplex was matrix inversion, and the solution came at rand with the revised simplex method and the pfi product form of inverse. the pfi allowed revised simplex to stay in the 'inverse space' and operate on column vectors, the now familiar 'leaving' and 'entering' vectors.

the new puzzle piece is that markowitz joined dantzig at rand, and by 1955 had introduced the alternative to pfi that's still standard today, the efi elimination form of inverse. efi is a mechanisation of the old 'gaussian elimination' taught in every linear algebra course for manual 'by hand' equation solving, but on a deeper level leads to the lu and cholesky factorizations, which are 'square-roots' of a matrix and numerically important for dealing with the 'squared units' of covariance matrices. cholesky was used for the earth gravity field solutions generated by the nasa topex and grace missions at center for space research in austin, and was part of the motivation for bringing cray supercomputers to utexas back in the seventies and eighties. 

so dantzig and markowitz were coding simplex at rand mid fifties, at the same time laning, battin, and kalman were coding missile guidance at mit instrumentation lab. how probable is it that they weren't aware of each other, if not actively discussing coding issues?

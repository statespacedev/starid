after the pdp-10 at swt san marcos in the early eighties came the utaustin astronomy department vax-11/780 in the late eighties and early nineties. there were a variety of astronomy and center for space research vax machines in those years, but this was the big one, and the one running bsd unix instead of vms. vms was fine and interesting, but with unix on the big vax and sun workstations, the spirit of the times was really about unix.

this was the period when vi, emacs, fortran, latex, x windows, perl, and tcsh became important parts of everyday life. both vi and emacs entered muscle memory, but only vi is still fully there and being used thirty-five years later.

the vax was the home of astro.utexas.edu email addresses, and they were one of the biggest and most visible groups of email users at utexas. it was possible to have a mail.utexas.edu address, but they were less visible on usenet and less preferred. an astro.utexas.edu address was special. there was a non-astronomer technical staff person, david, with an office around the corner from the vax room who took care of the systems and administered the user addresses.

in effect, the vax played the same role the pdp-10 had a few years earlier, essentially a kind of 'mainframe' role. the vax didn't have the old-style 'batch processing' facilities the pdp-10 had though, such as punch-card readers and bins for output fan-fold paper stacks. the difference was apparent in even the physical spaces associated with the two machines.

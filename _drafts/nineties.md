[paper 1997b](https://statespace.dev/docs/papers/1997%20lindblad.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

this second paper from 1997 is an interesting case, as it's the first in this collection to bring in the topic of neural networks. it also summarizes three similar papers, but they're pay-walled. a discussion of wider context seems useful at this point to set the stage for a separate detailed discussion. 

in an earlier discussion of a 1977 paper, mention is made of the resonance from 57 to 77 of the [fortran era and peak cold war](https://statespace.dev/aerospace/starid/starid77.html). there's an additional periodicity here, as this 1997 paper provides a time-capsule of the cold war's end. for those involved with astronomy and aerospace engineering around rlm and wrw at utaustin in 1990, the world had changed completely. aerospace shrank dramatically, as did neural networks. after another twenty years, both revived in an equally dramatic fashion. this is an interesting part of the project starid story to gradually explore.

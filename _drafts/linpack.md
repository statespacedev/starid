nsf funding at argonne national lab led to the fortran linear equation package linpack by the early seventies. it's closely tied to supercomputing and is the standard for [supercomputer benchmarking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK#World's_most_powerful_computer_by_year), from cdc and cray in the sixties and seventies through today.

[cleve moler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleve_Moler) and his advisor [george forsythe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Forsythe) at stanford in the sixties are of special interest in the linpack context. here's some comments from moler on 'computer solutions of linear algebraic systems', 1967, forsythe and moler

_this is a little book, it’s only less than 150 pages ... solving systems of simultaneous linear equations is arguably the most  important computation in scientific computing, it underlies everything else ... if you were let’s say studying control theory or finite element computations in engineering at this time, you would have used this subroutine from this book in your own program_

here's a [good review](docs/inverse/1966%20forsythe.pdf) by forsythe of the state of the art in the fifties and sixties, particularly around matrix inversion.

Baseball is not Mexico’s national pastime, and it is no longer the USA’s, but it is popular, particularly in the northern states. Beisbol was introduced to Mexico in 1847 by American soldiers during the Mexican War. Americans overseeing railroad construction also encouraged Mexican workers laying track to play beisbol. On July 4th, 1889 work stopped on the Monterrey-Tampico railway in Nuevo Leon to celebrate the holiday as Colonel Joseph Robertson and his workers played baseball. Organized beisbol started in 1925.

En 1873 contrajo matrimonio con Ida Wells, con quien tuvo dos hijos: Tradwell Ayres y Joseph Hugh[2].

En el año de 1896, el Gobierno del Estado le dio una concesión para construir una presa en el cañón de la Huasteca para tener un sistema de distribución de agua[9].

Robertson presentó un proyecto para la pavimentación de calles al gobernador Bernardo Reyes, quien se lo otorgó por varios años[11].
Sus negocios, al ser de ganancias no muy seguras, se vieron afectados por cobros y libranzas giradas en su contra durante la Revolución Mexicana, y decidió retirarse a Estados Unidos, falleciendo en San Antonio, Texas, en 1939[12].

Ann Z. Norton, 88, passed away on Saturday, October 14, 2017 in San Antonio. Born in Austin, TX on July 14, 1929 to Charles and Martha Ann Zivley, Ann was a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin. She studied art and got her degree in Education. While in her first teaching position in 1952 she met and married the love of her life, Stewart (Norty) Norton.
She was a very active art teacher at Pat Neff Middle School involving her students in many community projects. In the 1970s she designed the many architectural mosaic tile murals that her students made for the exterior walls of the school. These were installed by the Cavallini Co and can still be seen today. After she retired, she worked for Cavallini Stained Glass Company and was the designer for projects that involved the stained glass windows for many of the churches in the South Texas area.
She designed fabrics, printed and hand dyed silks that she made into dresses. Ann loved painting, especially watercolors as well as pen and ink detailed drawings. Her favorite subjects to paint were old farm houses and barns seen throughout south Texas many of which time has long since erased.
Ann was preceded in death by her husband, Norty. Survivors include her daughter, Karla Bagster-Stephens and husband Steve; a sister, JoLeta Gravit; a granddaughter, Nicole Bagster; two nephews, Brad and Bill Gravit; two nieces, Debbie and Suzanne Norton; and several great-nieces and nephews.

Jo Leta and her twin brother, George Andrew, children of Charles N. and Martha Ann Robertson Zivley, were born in Austin, Texas on July 26, 1934.  They were graduates of Austin High School and attended the University of Texas.  While at the University of Texas, Jo Leta became a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority.  Their philanthropic program remained important to her throughout her lifetime.
She was married to William Lindsay "Lynn" Gavit on May 31, 1958.  She was employed by the University of Texas in the Division of Extension while Lynn completed studies to become a Registered Pharmacist, after which she moved with him to Corpus Christi.  She was a home- maker during her children's early years, and became involved in several community activities on a volunteer basis.  She served as president of the Nueces County Pharmaceutical Auxiliary and was Co Chairman of the Texas Pharmaceutical Association State Convention in Corpus Christi.  She became a board member and later the Executive Director for United Cerebral Palsy of the Coastal Bend area.  In 1967 Jo Leta became the Volunteer Coordinator and Spokesman for the newly opened Corpus Christ State School, a position she held until she and her husband bought their own business and moved to Port Aransas to operate the Island Pharmacy in 1972.  In addition to working with her husband in the store she became aware of the need for a public library in Port Aransas and became a charter member of the William R "Bill" Ellis Library group, and assisted raising the funds needed to furnish the first Library, then housed in the Port Aransas City Hall.  She became a charter member of the Friends of Ellis Library, and her dedication to that organization continued for the rest of her life. She then spent one year updating the foyer in the City's hall, and later raised all the needed funds and headed the creation of the "Discover Port Aransas" exhibit in the same location.  She was a member of the UT/MSI Advisory Council.  She supported a number of   other civic projects during the many years she lived in Port Aransas.  Following the death of her husband in 1995 she served for many years as the manager of both her family's commercial and residential properties in Port Aransas.
She was preceded in death by her much beloved husband Lynn Gavit, both of her parents, her sister Ann and her twin brother, George.

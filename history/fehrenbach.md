In Texas the German people planted what was to be their only successful colony overseas. Other Americans, and Germans touring Texas, are often startled to hear German speech, and to find wholly German townships scattered through the scenic plateau on a diagonal stretching northwest above San Antonio from New Braunfels to Fredericksburg, and to find almost a dozen counties in this hill country where Germanic surnames predominate. Germans in Texas, not Indian-fighting pioneers, made the first permanent settlements above the Balcones fault.
This came about because of a tragicomic-romantic dream of a group of German noblemen, whose princedoms for the most part had been mediatized by Prussia. The vision and idealism of these princes is hard to fault, but the manner in which their ideas were implemented almost produced tragedy. It did result in one of the enduring legends of the Texas frontier, and in the end, sank German seed in Texas soil.
In 1842, these Prussian nobles formed the Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas, called thus the usual mixture of paternalistic idealism and mercantile colonialism that permeated many European had the reputation in Europe of having a healthful climate and good soils; it lacked the tariff and other barriers Adelsverein in German for short. The purposes of the Adelsverein were several: to create a new German fatherland in America, where the German working classes and peasantry might emigrate and prosper, thus opening new markets for the industry at home, also developing German maritime commerce. The concept was circles. It is certain that some of the men involved genuinely wanted to offer the crowded and oppressed peasantry in the industrializing Germanies a better life; others were seeking an opportunity to plant German influence, if not the flag, overseas. The Republic of Texas was chosen as the colonial base, for three reasons. It had the reputation in Europe of having a healthful climate and good soils; it lacked the tariff and other barriers erected by the United States and other American republics; and last, Texas was small and emerging, and the princes hoped the German immigrants would be able to take and hold an influential, if not dominant, place in the Republic.
The Society sent one of its most energetic members, Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels, to Texas in 1844, while thousands of emigrants were recruited in the north-central German states. The Society offered the following bargain to each willing head of household for $240 and a promise to cultivate at least 15 acres for three years: free transportation to Texas, free land (320 acres per family), a log house, financing through his first crop, and a system of public services, such as mills, gins, hospitals, churches, asylums, and the like built at Adelsverein expense in the community. Only some $80,000 was raised by the noble members to finance these services. This was extremely optimistic, but the Society was mistakenly convinced that huge profits would be made soon by the sale of Texas lands. The Adelsverein had acquired the old Fisher-Miller empresario grant and proposed to settle half and sell the other.
This was one of the great and unheralded land swindles of the century, because Fisher and Miller not only had no right to sell the land, as the Germans thought, but when the transaction took place, they had already forfeited their empresario contract through failure to implement it in time. The fact that the entire grant lay soils without much rainfall were not understood by the Adelsverein until 1847 - when 7,000 or more German inside Indian country, was far removed from all Texas civilization, and possessed only thin and stony settlers had already arrived in Texas. The two noble agents who investigated Texas in 1844 na√Øvely assumed that the geographical characteristics of the state were similar throughout. They never set foot on, or went near, the 3,000,000 acres the Adelsverein believed it had acquired. Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels was thirty-three, handsome, and a first cousin to Queen Victoria. He was also something of a monumental fool, though he undoubtedly meant well. In Texas, he rode up the Colorado bottoms, displaying both aristocratic snobbery toward the rather rough-cut planters and intolerance toward the system of Negro slavery. This, his appearance in full uniform with sword and decorations, and his retinue of servants, valet, architect, cook, secretary, and someone hired as a "professional hunter," strained even the famous Texas hospitality.
Solms-Braunfels realized that the Fisher-Miller lands were too far from the coast to be reached at once by the emigrants who had already set sail behind him. Therefore, he set out to acquire nearer tracts, to be used as staging areas. After some difficulty, twice making deals with men who didn't own what they sold, he did secure some broad lands just above the sharp rise of the Balcones fault. The Prince was delighted with this country, which lay partway on the route to the Fisher-Miller grant. The fraying limestone had spectacular scenic beauty; the creeks and rivers ran clear, their beds green with watercress; the giant cypresses growing incongruously this far west along the waters and the pecan trees sprinkling the valleys made it seem fertile and rich. The Prince ignored miles of unpreempted black, rich soils below the scarp, and chose a site near a waterfall on the Guadalupe. He called this townsite New Braunfels. A large log house was thrown up and named Die Sophienburg, in honor of a light o'love.
But now crisis was crowding the Prince of Solms-Braunfels. Several thousand German peasants, recruited mostly from the Hesses, Hannover, Brunswick, and other central German states, were piling up on the docks at Galveston. They were transshipped to the Adelsverein base at Indianola, a landing point on the Gulf. These people were arriving with stars in their eyes; Texas was described in German newspapers as the land of milk and honey, full of Biblical promise. In crowded Germany, where farmers were used to working their lives out on fractional plots, the concept of 320 acres was almost too much to bear. Geh mit ins Texas (Go with us to Texas) they told each other, and the Adelsverein had almost 10,000 recruits.
It was also almost bankrupt. The Fisher-Miller lands could not be exploited, at least for years, and many promises were not to be kept. The Einwanderer or immigrants were left camping on the fever coast, while plans were changed. Miserable, hungry, wan after weeks on shipboard, these stolid families sickened; infants died, and the great exodus quickly turned into a nightmare. Typhus broke out, and Texas was becoming a German grave.
At about this point Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels resigned his commission and went home. He turned over the project of settling these countrymen to his deputy, Otfried Hans, Freiherr von Meusebach. Fortunately, Von Meusebach possessed the most important requisite of the true pioneer: he was adaptable. With great good sense, he began to call himself "John O. Meusebach" among the Texans; he took Texan citizenship, and to the people of Texas he was always known as John Meusebach, a good man to do business with all around. He tried desperately to get the Germans off the unhealthy coast, but due to war conditions in Texas it was impossible to hire enough freight wagons. The immigrants set out on foot, for a journey of some 300 miles. It was again a time of unusual storms and rains in east Texas. The ragged stream of humanity had to cross swollen rivers and toil day after day through endless mud. Then, the sun burned out, as they crawled westward. Along this march from Indianola to New Braunfels, many immigrants peeled off; exhausted or sick, they stayed behind and settled where they stopped. But the main body toiled on; soon, the Germans were leaving a trail of dead in their wake. The pitiful letters sent back to Germany reveal that the most fervent wish of many on this trek was that they be buried if they fell. A pillar of circling vultures followed the column for many days.
They came into the New Braunfels region and founded their town in 1845. Here, at least the climate was healthful and the country fair, though the farmers looked with some dismay at the hardscrabble rocks and flinty soils. Prince Solms-Braunfels had chosen lovely country, but not one in which pioneers could easily make a living. But the Germans spread through the valleys, and here and there they discovered sufficient meadow plots and plowable fields. Meusebach realized that the New Braunfels community could not support all the thousands on the road. He needed more lands further west, toward the grant. He sought out the Penateka Comanches, who owned this country, and began to parley. His great point was that his people were neither Texan nor Mexican, two tribes the Comanches hated. The Penateka councils agreed to share their hunting grounds with los Alemanes, whom they recognized as a separate tribe. Meusebach offered the Indians about $3,000 worth of gifts, and in March 1847, a deal was made. Meanwhile, during the parleying, the town of Fredericksburg, some eighty miles northwest of New Braunfels, had already been founded.
This Comanche-German treaty was never broken, but there was bloodshed when the Indians became embittered by other white aggressions in later years. Indians could not easily distinguish one Caucasian from another, and after 1860 much German hair adorned Comanche lodge poles. The Germans founded a series of communities, in a long, fragmented stream reaching west from New Braunfels. Sisterdale, Boerne, Comfort, and several other small towns were planted through the hills. A handful of Germans even reached the Fisher-Miller lands, in the future Mason County, but the rainfall and the Indian attitude was too uncertain for the main body. During 1844-46 the Adelsverein brought 7,380 Germans into Texas, and most of these, and the thousands who followed later, settled along the Balcones Scarp just above San Antonio. Though the Society went bankrupt in 1847, Meusebach stayed in Texas, working for the cause. The Germans underwent terrible hardships, but they were peasant-tough; they had avoided trouble with the Comanches, and they survived.
After 1848, a number of German intellectuals fled to Texas. There was one German utopian colony in the Fisher-Miller grant, called the "Latin Colony" because, although none of these people had ever farmed before, they were well educated. Although all the Germans were confirmed by the state in their lands, this colony went the way of most utopian communities on the frontier.
The Germans farmed intensively, on small plots, and they created a lasting impression of being better agriculturists than Anglos. But their influence on Texas farming has been overestimated. They settled in poor soils, compared to the heartland regions, and they adapted to the Texas frontier, rather than attempting to create a transplanted European way of life.
Along the Pedernales and other central Texas streams, the Germans farmed and ranched next to the Alabamans and Tennesseeans filtering down the same valleys; and the two soon became almost indistinguishable. Although the Germans clung to their language in these hills, they adopted Texas agriculture.
They abandoned wheat and rye for corn, and they soon let their stock run wild as the Southerners did, although such a custom was unheard of in Europe. The first German log cabins looked like Anglo cabins, and the small, limestone houses that followed them and soon weathered to a rich beige were Southwestern in style. This architecture, like the Victorian mansions along the San Antonio River the German patricians were soon building to the south, was not German; rather, it followed the dominant style of its place and time. Only the early churches looked European; they were transplanted cultural influences, like the Lutheran and Catholic creeds themselves.
Outside of the German tongue, which remained primary for about one hundred years, the other cultural differences, such as women working peasantlike in the fields, soon passed away. The one big difference between the Anglo and the German farmer was that the latter was less mobile. When the German put down roots, he did not leave. This trait later was praised extensively, but the 19th-century Germans who stubbornly clung to their small rocky farms in the Hill Country fell into a kind of trap. They farmed intensively, in a day when land was open and could be acquired extensively by men of enterprise or vision. Those Germans who left the enclaves and entered the plantation economy did remarkably well, and those, like the Kleberg family, which intermarried with the Kings and eventually came to own the vast King Ranch, showed ability equal or superior to the Anglos at empire-building.
With their dominant peasant ethos, most Germans put enormous labor into their farms, but it took a century for most of them to prosper. They remained an isolated, ingrown community, healthy enough in themselves, stubbornly self-reliant, but adding few influences to the whole state.
The Europeans who struck out for the towns and settlements did vastly better. By 1860, there were more than 5,000 German-born citizens in San Antonio; these outnumbered the native Mexicans. More important, these immigrants, many of whom were middle class in origin, gave south Texas its first large mercantile and financial patriciate. They originated and founded most of the business enterprises in San Antonio, from banks to lumberyards, and with the Alsatian-French refugees from Castroville, soon gave San Antonio, with its Casino Club, a cosmopolitan air utterly unlike Anglo-Texas.
Noticeably, also, the Texas Europeans who settled in the towns quickly lost their foreign languages and cultures; these towns were small, and had no foreign quarters like those found in the North. The San Antonio Germans lost their German language at least two generations before the hill people did, and this same pattern held true with other groups, such as Czechs or Poles.
The heaviest European immigration, proportionally, arrived in these years, but compared to that in other parts of America, it was small. There were some 32,000 Western Europeans in Texas in 1860, but there were more than 400,000 native whites, and the European influences, although apparent and important in certain enclaves, never had any appreciable political or cultural influence on the State.
Alsace, France, Czech
Just as the Mexican presence that clung stubbornly to the fringe areas of Texas was outside or beyond the Anglo heartland, the great part of the European immigration avoided the Anglo regions. In 1860, there were slightly more than 30,000 European-born citizens in Texas. The vast majority were settled in the south- southwest, somewhere west and south of the Colorado. Unlike much of the foreign immigration that was now pouring into the northern United States, these migrants were almost entirely rurally oriented and agricultural. During the 1820s and 1830s a number of French and Germans (Austrians and Swiss were among these, but usually called themselves Germans) entered Texas, but these men or families came individually. They either took up farming or sought employment as mechanics or artisans in the settlements, almost always founding their own businesses, since none existed before they came. The early immigrants joined in with the people of Anglo-Texas and almost invariably lost their European cultural identity quickly. The people who arrived in the 1840s and later did not, because they came en masse and formed enclaves. Meanwhile, the Irish colonies in south Texas had thrown in their lot with the Anglos politically in 1835, and except for a lasting Catholicism in some families, were hardly distinguishable from the Anglo mass. In Texas, no potato-famine Irish ever arrived. The first successful non-English-speaking enclave was founded by Henri de Castro, on the Medina River fifty miles southwest of San Antonio in September 1844. Castro's empresario grant, which included lands far south and west to the border, was in the path of the Comanche raiding trail to Mexico. He placed his town of Castroville in its safest, far northeastern corner. This was beautiful, rolling country, on the fringes of the Balcones Scarp, with a band of tall cypresses rising along the clear Medina. The region had stretches of fertile, river-valley soils, much like the area immediately surrounding San Antonio, though the general tenor of the landscape was rock and brush. Castro began with 300 colonists, most of whom were French citizens of Alsatian origin.
Though Henri de Castro himself went bankrupt in the process, he advertised widely in France and the regions of the Upper Rhine in Germany. He acquired many colonists. Medina County, which grew from this settlement of Castroville, spread for some miles along the river on either side of the town, which retained a certain Old World charm, blended with the starkness of the New World frontier. In three years, Castro brought a total of 2,134 settlers in through the Gulf of Mexico. The majority of these were listed in old censuses as French, but this tended to be confusing. They were primarily ethnic Alsatians; they spoke a Germanic tongue, and in Texas they generally described themselves as "Germans." A number of the Castroville people were also Swabians, W√ºrttembergers, and Swiss. They were heavily Catholic, and built one of the first non-Hispanic Roman churches in Texas. This colony clung, grew, and spread north and east until it merged, almost imperceptibly, with spreading German settlement coming down from the Balcones Scarp. The Castroites, however, kept their own historic and sentimental identity; in the 20th century thousands of south-central Texans, who could no longer speak a foreign language, referred to themselves as "Alsatians." They held annual mass reunions, but more from historic sentiment than cultural aloofness, for they had become indistinguishable from most Anglo-Texans.
There was a French colony, founded on the socialist principles of Fourier, established not far from Dallas in 1855. Here, 500 people gathered, cooperated briefly, quarreled, and drifted away. This colony, La Reunion, failed, but many of its educated French zealots stayed within the state. Small Scandinavian and Czech groups arrived in the 1840s. The Czechs (listed under Austrian nationality) were mainly intellectuals, fleeing the turmoil and repressions of 1848. They achieved, because of their level of culture, a remarkable influence in the skimpy intellectual landscape, though they merged quickly with the frontier population. Bedicheks and Nowaks soon sat comfortably in the pews of the Baptist Church. English and Scots entered Texas. Forty-odd men born in the British Isles died in the Alamo, but since none of these came in bunches, and merged rapidly, they left no lasting mark, except Scots names on many of the places along the frontier. Cameron County, where both Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma were fought, was named for a Scot in the Texas service.
Mexico
The striking feature of the southwestern regions of Texas is that the border settlements were organized and dominated by people the Mexicans called Anglos, but who were primarily European immigrants. Germans, French, Austrians, and other assorted nationalities drifted to the frontier of Texas in those years in large numbers. They joined with a few Americans, almost all of whom came out of the Northern states, such as Pennsylvania or New York. These men were traders or merchants, following professions largely outside the Southern ethos; just as Pennsylvania Presbyterians had become the merchant class of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, they cropped up surprisingly often on the dusty border, where the economy was entirely based on the Mexico trade and supplying Army garrisons. Conspicuous examples of these mercantilists were Captains Kennedy and King, who first arrived in South Texas as steamboat men serving the U.S. forces holding the Rio Grande. There were ephemeral fortunes to be made freighting and trading along the Rio Grande, and these men filled a vacuum the native Spanish-speaking ranchers could not fill. They hauled goods, loaned money, and acquired lands.
The tenor of Mexican life remained almost unchanged at the bottom, but at the top political control passed completely into the hands of the new arrivals. American and European immigrants organized the new counties, assumed the offices, and ran the country. This was not part of any ethnic plot to dispossess the Mexicans, who by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were U.S. citizens. But few Mexicans were literate; they refused to learn English, and even the upper class was entirely ignorant of Anglo-Saxon institutions and control passed into the hands of recent American or European arrivals, from Brownsville to San Antonio. The judges as they were told by Anglo merchants and bankers. In these first years, however, there was much social politics and tended to be contemptuous of both. Under these circumstances political as well as economic, Mexicans, whose vote was all-important, were "voted," as the saying went. They elected Anglo sheriffs and mixture and intermarriage between American newcomers-the merchant adventurers, unlike farmers out of Tennessee, rarely brought wives-and members of the Spanish upper castes.
In the 1850s, the border towns of El Paso and Brownsville, and San Antonio itself, were dominated by a handful of leading merchants or financial men, none of whom were born in Texas or the South. This peculiar politico-social system, in which ethnic Mexicans usually possessed numerical superiority but remained politically inert as individuals, became a lasting feature of south-Texas life. It was a logical outcome to centuries of Hispanic-Mexican tradition, in which the Indian and mestizo base were allowed no function in politics, and in which even the Spanish landed elite possessed no initiative beyond being permitted to sit on local municipal councils. Another feature of this developing society was that the American or Americanized newcomers acquired extensive lands; the early entrepreneur, if he stayed, became a rancher. In this way Richard King and Mifflin Kenedy, who with a few others at one time dominated all Texas south of the Nueces from Brownsville, became two of the largest landowners in the South. In the 1850s the nucleus of the immense King Ranch was formed.
In this way, also, much of the old caste and class structure of Mexico was perpetuated in south Texas. An Anglo-Saxon, or mixed Anglo-European-Spanish caste replaced the old Spanish land grantees at the apex of society. Although the new structure was American-oriented, English-speaking, and politically aware, it unconsciously adopted much of the patronizing attitude of the rancheros, whose ignorance of and impatience with the vagaries of American law and political practice completed their decline. Many Spanish landowners could never adapt to the American practice of taxation, where lands were taxed on assessed values, rather than merely on what they happened to produce from year to year. Each party-American and Spanish- considered the other system immoral, but the older owners' failure to exploit their lands cost them many titles through public sales. Further, the vast majority of Mexican inhabitants of the border regions could never make up their minds as to citizenship-American or Mexican for almost one hundred years. This left them able to enter Mexico any time they chose, and many Texas-born Mexicans became prominent in Mexican government over the years, but it left them at a disadvantage at home.
America
Almost half the settled regions of Texas, extending beyond the river-bottom plantation belts, were populated by yeoman farmers, hill and forest men from the South. This area built a frontier farm economy and a frontier crop system very similar to that of the Midwest. The people who staked out their small farms along this great semicircle, reaching from Sherman-Denison in the north down to the vicinity of Austin, were alien, even hostile, to black servitude. The society was a rough, scattered one of distant small farms dotting the broad horizons. It was puritan, hardy, hardworking, and intolerant, in the way the Anglo-Celtic frontier of America had always been. The people had a passion for the land and an everlasting bias against social organism.
Thus this region between the Sabine and the Gulf and the inland, rising plateau line, where antebellum settlement stopped, which was to become the heartland of the state, was already divided economically and socially between the two great divisions of the old South, the old plantation and the old frontier. The coastal nucleus of Texas consisted of great plantations laid out among the moss-hung oaks along the broad, muddy rivers, where cotton grew splendidly in the mucky alluvial soils. Inland, where gently rolling post-oak belts and rich, blackland prairies began, the country was a series of log cabins and rough-hewed farm fences, enclosing fields of straggling corn. Beyond the oak and prairie belt, where the horizons broadened into rising plateaus of low, flat, stony-soiled hills, and the enormous seas of grass began, the settlement dribbled out. The cabins became more distant, separated by miles and miles, and the settlements significantly were no longer called towns, but forts. If the lights in the Texas forest by the middle of the 19th century were still few, in the middle of the state, on a north-south line that extended only a few miles south of San Antonio, the lights on the edge of the Plains were swallowed in vastness.
Within the confines of this prairie province, between the deep pine woods and the semidesert on the west, in a broad band running southeast from Dallas-Fort Worth to the fringes of Austin, excluding San Antonio, and curving inward toward the coast along the Guadalupe River-an expanded Colorado-Trinity enclave-most of the migrants settled, and a hundred years afterward, in these regions most Texans still lived. This must be called the Anglo heartland. It was completely agricultural in occupation, rural in outlook, ethnically divided the old South and the old Southern frontier.
The origins of immigration into this heartland provide the key to Texan institutions and history as a whole. In 1836 the total population consisted of approximately 30,000 Anglo whites, 4,000 Mexicans, and 5,000 Negro slaves. By 1847, there were 100,000 Anglo whites, who owned 40,000 slaves. An enormous part of the early influx was made up of Southern planters, who came to acquire cheap or free lands, and brought their capital in the form of Negroes. For some years, the greatest inflow came from the upper regions of the South, hill men and small farmers, who took up the outer fringes of the heartland. In fact, immigration into Texas was almost equally divided between the upper and the deep South, but the percentage of Negroes, with the steady expansion of the cotton kingdom, rose. In 1850, Texas had 154,034 whites, 397 black freemen, and 58,161 slaves. But ten years later, in 1860, in a total population of 604,215, there were 182,000 slaves. These blacks were not spread evenly throughout the settled portions of the state. They were confined almost entirely to the eastern plantations; on the western frontier, and south of the Guadalupe River, slaves existed only rarely, and then as house or body servants.
This immigration into Texas was part of the expansion of the South itself; it was not an expansion out of the adjacent states of Louisiana or Arkansas, but by families who leapfrogged from Alabama or Tennessee. One- half the white population came from these two states, Alabama and Tennessee. These settlers largely came from the hill and forest sections, not from the plantation South; they were "red-necks" or yeoman farmers who went entirely into the prairie and post-oak regions far up the Texas rivers. They wanted to get away from the slave plantations, with which they could not compete; they could most easily acquire land on the far edge of settlement, and there was, noticeably, in these people an urge toward the far frontier. They took their cabin lights to the edge of Indian country.
Beyond even the Alabamans and men from Tennessee, there was a fringe of Missourians-these were borderers who pushed early across the Mississippi from Kentucky, and then moved southwest. Georgia and Mississippi supplied large contingents, especially to the plantation regions near the coast.
Georgians went heavily into the pine woods in the northeast and were also responsible for the growth of plantations along the Red. Only a small minority of Texas immigrants came from Louisiana and Arkansas in the years before 1860.
Because of climate, occupation, familiarity, and associations, immigrants congregated remarkably in certain regions. The Louisianans were mainly sugar planters or merchants. They rarely ventured beyond sight or smell of the Gulf of Mexico. They formed an actual majority of settlers from the Sabine to Galveston Bay; they made small enclaves at the mouths of the Nueces and even the distant Rio Grande.
Georgians and Mississippians stayed in the vicinity of Nacogdoches, expanding the slave society northward to the Red. One large group of Mississippi people gathered far south on the Guadalupe, however, and brought Negroes further south than they had been before. Other planters from these states helped fill the prairies between the river bottoms near the coast. The Alabamans almost always went west of the coastal plains, up to where the rolling hills and oak trees began. They staked out their farms in rolling, grassy, tree-studded country, where once the Tawakonis and Wacos of the Wichita tribes had made a buffer between the Comanches and the coast. The Tennesseeans went even further west, across the two large prairie bands of north-central Texas, and to the edge of the cross timbers that stopped abruptly near Fort Worth. Here, there were also enclaves of Alabamans and Missourians, but the great outer frontier was populated primarily from Tennessee.
A phenomenon of this settlement was that pioneers from different distant areas did not usually congregate or mix. For hundreds of miles along a certain band, settlers from one region, such as Alabama or Tennessee, would be a hundred to a hundred fifty times more numerous than settlers from all other states combined. Mississippians and Georgians likewise peopled entire counties, and built them in a familiar image. The Missourians on the rimlands retained a Western, rather than a Southern, flavor. Ninety percent of all Texas immigration arrived out of the Southern states, but this did not mean it was entirely cohesive: west and east Texas re-created something similar to the old division between Appalachia and the tidewater.
One real variation in Texas, compared to the South, was the percentage of European immigration. In 1860, 43,422 Texans were foreign-born. Of these, 12,000 were Mexicans; "foreign," although most had been born in Texas, since they had not been born citizens of the United States. This Mexican population was almost entirely south of the Colorado River, and outside the heartland of Anglo-Texas. In the early 1840s the Mavericks and a few others were the only Anglos in San Antonio, and there was only a handful of non-Mexicans in the settlements north of the Rio Grande.
The advance to the 98th meridian from the old colony of Texas differed in no important way from the march out of Appalachia. The first men up the long rivers, the Brazos and Colorado, were Indian traders, who built blockhouses or forts, usually at forks or fords. A few families, living mainly by hunting, filtered in. Then, the remorseless push of the earth-breaking pioneer ruined both the good hunting and the Indian trade. Between 1836 and 1860 this advance into Indian country was similar to what it had been in the United States. First, Lamar's Texas militia drove the settled Indians out of the lands the whites coveted. Later, after 1845, the U.S. Army took over this function, first herding the remaining Indians further up the rivers, then, finally, unable to restrain the public clamor or protect the now pitiful remnants of the agricultural tribes, the whole conquered Indian population was marched north into Oklahoma.
By the middle decade of the century, Texas had carved a thousand-mile-long frontier into the center of the state. Counties were organized up to, and beyond, the actual settlement frontier. In the far south, Cameron County, with its seat at Brownsville, reached upward from the Rio Grande to Corpus Christi on the Nueces. Like the limits of the old Spanish land grants, legal boundaries proceeded many leagues ahead of the people themselves. Maps of the time could be misleading.
The most important factor in this development was that politically, socially, and economically the American frontier in Texas did not differ radically from the conditions of the 18th century. There were three great classes of people, excluding Indians and slaves: subsistence farmers, cotton planters, and the inhabitants of the towns. The towns were few and far between. The vast landscape was overwhelmingly rural. The pattern of society was the same: hunter-trader-trapper on the far frontier; hunter-farmer behind him through a large yeoman belt; then the planters, forging their own kind of civilized existence in the rear. The towns, most of which were minor ports or river stations or mere crossroads settlements, supported this settlement when and where they could. Cities were not needed; none arose in the Texas heartland, in the antebellum years.
The vast majority of people lived no better, and most of them lived considerably worse, than the colonial inhabitants of British America. This was not due to any regression, but to the almost fantastic explosion of the settlement frontier. People continually outran their civilization when they passed beyond the reach of roads and rivers, and the countryside did not yet have rails.
Texas conditions were everywhere rougher and more primitive than in other states; many travelers noted this. During the whole antebellum era Texas was still a log cabin frontier. Although in the southwest Mexican inhabitants clung sensibly to adobe, or sun-dried clay bricks, and in the hill country the new German immigrants began building sturdy houses of native beige limestone, the vast majority of Anglo-Texans made dwellings out of hand-cut logs. Even in 1860, when sawmills had become more common in the state, most Texas farmers lived in homemade log cabins. The quality of cut lumber, and the shanties made out of it, tended to be wretched, and no improvement over hand-hewed timbers.
The home of the ordinary Texas settler was called a "dog-run." It consisted of two separate rooms or cabins connected under a continuous roof, but with an open corridor or "dog-run" left in between. This double cabin was usually built in segments, one room at a time. A porch was commonly extended in front of the dog-run house; this provided storage space for harness, tools, kegs, and saddles and a place for men and hounds to rest out of the hot sun.

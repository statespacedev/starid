sorry some details must have gotten mixed up. the DEC-10 system was in louisville (UofL), administered by mark hittinger. the kentucky universities had an agreement to share computing resources. UK (lexington) had an IBM mainframe. the DEC-10 was way more fun and interesting so that’s what got me hooked. there was a microwave link to louisville (~80 miles). eric and i met when the DEC-10 was still operational. same for sean casey. the hang out was mcvey hall where most of the computing resources were located (the IBM 360 mainframe was in the basement, TVI910+ terminals on the first floor). the DEC-10 shut down in 1985 if i recall. i think eric graduated by then. when the DEC-10 shut down, i started using local unix systems. labs popped up around the UK campus. one of those was with math sciences, a joint venture of the mathematics, statistics, and computer sciences departments. math sciences went the unix route which made sense as that’s where all the innovations were. (separate note - the mcvey folks stuck to their overpriced and useless IBM mainframe and fell behind the times). i met bill stoll, david herron, etc at math sciences, likely because sean moved to those unix systems and introduced them to me. bill wrote uniwar while at math sciences. i really am not aware of any connection with utexas. maybe mark hittinger had one, but i never even saw the DEC-10. i was just a remote user, and unauthorized for most of my time on that system so i was in the fringe as far as knowing details of how that system was operated by mark.

sorry some details must have gotten mixed up. the DEC-10 system was in louisville (UofL), administered by mark hittinger. the kentucky universities had an agreement to share computing resources. UK (lexington) had an IBM mainframe. the DEC-10 was way more fun and interesting so that‚Äôs what got me hooked. there was a microwave link to louisville (~80 miles). eric and i met when the DEC-10 was still operational. same for sean casey. the hang out was mcvey hall where most of the computing resources were located (the IBM 360 mainframe was in the basement, TVI910+ terminals on the first floor). the DEC-10 shut down in 1985 if i recall. i think eric graduated by then. when the DEC-10 shut down, i started using local unix systems. labs popped up around the UK campus. one of those was with math sciences, a joint venture of the mathematics, statistics, and computer sciences departments. math sciences went the unix route which made sense as that‚Äôs where all the innovations were. (separate note - the mcvey folks stuck to their overpriced and useless IBM mainframe and fell behind the times). i met bill stoll, david herron, etc at math sciences, likely because sean moved to those unix systems and introduced them to me. bill wrote uniwar while at math sciences. i really am not aware of any connection with utexas. maybe mark hittinger had one, but i never even saw the DEC-10. i was just a remote user, and unauthorized for most of my time on that system so i was in the fringe as far as knowing details of how that system was operated by mark. 

ahha!!! ok, wasn't understanding meaning of UK - that helps! just meant decwar had spread from utexas up to that area and become uniwar there - seems like a cool part of the history!:) and the most fun part is that eric learned about it up there and then later arrived in austin and started working on decwar without knowing that was the starting point - it's really a fun kinda 'loop':)(Edited)

nicely 'packaged' for 'everyone', especially students, both authentic old decwar and state of the art new decwar - both old and new together, side by side - and here's the thing - to have ai 'agents' as part of the package so no-one ever again sees the game 'alone' - they always see a rousing battle, albeit ai agents - and then we're brainstorming doing some things with that in austin at the least - installation with cool audio and visual 'space' for people to explore and get hands on, and see some of the history of the whole saga - photos etc(Edited) celebration of everything around decwar and that eraüëç

Joel, for me this started as an exercising in thinking about what my students are going to do next fall. They are beginning/intermediate programmers and we do a lot of retro game reverse engineering and recreating.  I went down a text only path and that reminded me of you and Decwar years ago.  So I started looking in that direction, which led me to Harris Newman, who has been very helpful.  I decided in about a day this was way too much for my students, but I was already hooked on coding it (just as a personal challenge).  I also thought if they had a running system we could easily instrument they could do some cool graphics and sound around a running game.

In a totally coincidental side thread, I'd seen (nothing to do with decwar) that PiPD-10 work and asked my wife to get me one for my birthday.  That led to a posting by Noah in the PiDP-10 forum about a week after I'd started the port (which was kind mind blowing synchronicity) and then without asking Harris introduced me to Noah.
We also have an annual student/dept showcase in nov, so we are doing some thinking around that with Mk Haley, who is at UT and a former Disney Imagineer. Also a possible Siggraph event in 2026. This is literally a project that seems to be writing its own script as we go. Joel, I graduated in 88 I believe ,but had probably moved on to the AT&T unix lab and no longer visited McVey much (I think). then at Bloomington for 2 years, then Yale

my dad‚Äôs DEC-10 account with the sociology department had been shut down for quite some time already.  so you have to wonder - what did he think i was doing at mcvey 20 hours at a time?
the real problems came later when i couldn‚Äôt show my face in mcvey anymore and dialed in over modem straight to louisville.
the accounts were segregated.  louisville accounts could not login on the TTYs associated with the microwave lines from lexington.  there were probably two orders of magnitude more potential accounts in the louisville pool to hack.
so i had to dial long distance to louisville.  strangely in state long distance cost more than calling to the next state.  some weird regulation or lack of regulation in the state, not sure.
so there was some of that phone stuff.  you do that long enough from your home phone‚Ä¶
long story short, a kind person in louisville tipped me when the FBI started making calls to the UofL university administrators.
jakydude ‚Äî 23:10
the local unix labs were the next targets
i was easy to spot.  those systems couldn‚Äôt support many users.  ultimately the folks at math sciences asked me to come into the office for a talk.  they said they would just give me an account if i would stop breaking into other people‚Äôs accounts.  then they could keep an eye on me.  worked for me.  and then i became a convert from black hat to white hat.
that‚Äôs pretty much it
by the time i started school at UK, the math sciences folks created an RA position for me and i became part of the staff.  to keep out hackers and run their systems.  it paid my way through school. 
if UofL really wanted to make an example of me, they probably could have.  but i disappeared.  and there weren‚Äôt many laws on the books back then.  cyber crimes were still a new thing.
i have a really interesting story for some future time - very confidential emails concerning staff, students, and faculty were mysteriously being found on all the local printers.
so the assumption was someone with a grudge was hacking root access, reading people‚Äôs email, and then spooling anything they didn‚Äôt like so it would cause a big fuss.
it was a really interesting two months where i systematically tracked down the person and then logged all of their behavior so the school admins could take action

joel what was the situation with arpanet there? was it available at all? for me i doubt it was in san marcos, but austin had an early imp - it's on the deservedly famous map 
another even more obscure part of the story is the aerospace parts in the seventies and eighties - would like to explore that - this stuff is way more interesting than the usual 'personal computers' fare, for me - and the ai strands eric 
so for the austin story - ai natural language, bob taylor from utexas to arpa, super star trek, mcdonald and apollo, transit, antartica, gravity mapping, subs, oil exploration, lunar laser ranging, gps, arpanet, imp, pdp10, decwar, csr, cray, mcc, lisp machines, seasat, topex poseidon, hipparcos, hubble, grace, icesat, gsfc, jpl, ucboulder, lasp, nist

I was on usenet (alt.sys.pdp10) in the early 90's searching, pleading for
someone to release the code.  I at that time used sdf.org for email.  (If
you don't know about sdf.org, it's out of San Antonio, and is a bunch of
unix servers that are exposed to the internet.  He runs several pdp-10
simulations on it as well, which you can get access to for free.  I got a
lifetime membership for like $35 and still use it!).

I got an email around 1995 with a large mime attachment with the source
code on sdf.org.  I am sure I got it around then because I remember other
things that set that year (I was married to my 1st wife then, etc).

I normally keep my old emails (esp so important as this one), but I can't
find it now (I looked multiple times on sdf.org too).  I had a ton of cd's
and floppies with it backed up that I went through last week but none have
the original email.   I moved from Round Rock to Portland Oregon 4 years
ago and during that time we downsized multiple times and most of my
floppies/cd's are gone.

I had no way to distribute the code until I came across the Dolph Briscoe
Center for American History, and in 2011 and arranged for the return of the
code to UT, for distribution.

It's frustrating to me that I can't find that email.  I'm going to continue
looking, but I am losing faith that I can find it.  Those floppies I
had...I am so frustrated that I didn't keep them.

I do have emails of who I talked with at the Briscoe center, it was Zach
Vowell,
Hope this helps,  So, when can we play a game?

so after sleeping on it a bit, realized we should update joel - we got a beautiful reply from harris today. here's a nutshell -
harris was on alt.sys.pdp-10 in the early nineties, hunting for decwar source code - i was lurking there too and suspect i remember this 
in 1995 somebody sent harris an email with the compuserve source code attached
that original email is now lost and we don't know who the sender was 
to add one additional fact, merlyn got the compuserve code from harris and around 2012 did some intense hacking and got it to run on simh pdp-10. he put that on github at that time. merlyn has said he was using ddt debugger to accomplish that - it was a major achievement. 
with project utexas, roughly april and may this year we set out to start from the compuserve code and go backwards, to converge back on the utexas original and to make it more easily usable by more people. and now here we are 

jakydude ‚Äî 08:06
wow that‚Äôs all so cool
so ‚Äúhe put that on github at that time‚Äù means it is on github?  the version you started with?  or it was put and then lost?

Noah ‚Äî 08:14
yep the github repo drforbin decwar is the compuserve code that merlyn got from harris and debugged in 2012.
for a little more detail about that compuserve code - it is essentially the tape that utexas sent to compuserve in 1982
compuserve added a few things, and modified a few things - but the skeleton is all there - pure 'utexas tape'
so what we're doing now in 'the utexas folder' is washing out the compuserve impurities - we want it to look, taste, smell and feel like the original utexas tape - and everyone to be able to easily use it on their raspi
and the dream is - if we can recover a real life physical original utexas tape - it will match up closely with our 'utexas23-reconstruction' 
this is all what we mean by going 'backwards in time'
it's fun, and not impossible - the key thing is that our starting point is actually close to the destination - the compuserve impurities are pretty minor - cosmetics basically 

20250608

this is fun - hit some kinda milestone - 
have multiple 'agents' telnetting in from laptop and 'playing the game'!
it's alive!!!
the agents are super brainless - just randomly moving around üòÑ 
but they create a 'game loop' and drive the action - the romulan is jumping in and creating some mayhemüòÑ
not even going to begin thinking about adding brains to the agents, aka 'machine learning training em', yet - for this weekend will just add fun things like look for targets, and auto attack if anything's in rangeüôÇ
wow, brainstorm - will put a cli on the agent code and have a shell script start a few agents on each side
will start creating personalities for some of them already - dialog for them to send over the radio
Eric ‚Äî 00:40
cool
Noah ‚Äî 00:41
a memory came back - back in the day, had just seen blade runner
would play as 'batty' and radio stuff like 'fiery the angels fell' etc
Eric ‚Äî 00:42
i worked in a movie theater when Bladerunner came out
Noah ‚Äî 00:42
batty will ride again this weekend!
Eric ‚Äî 00:42
very fun to watch reactions of people leaving after the movie
Noah ‚Äî 00:43
can have some fun star trek personalities too - scotty lives!
and bones mccoy;)
he's dead, jim:)

looking at eric's folder listing, here's a fun historical note - compuserve had each command as a separate file - so torpedo, tractor, tell, etc - merlyn worked on and debugged that compuserve code from 2011/2012 onward - makes tons of sense and totally natural, no problemo 
then the pidp-10 came out around a year ago -
my first thought was of course 'hey, let's get that github decwar going, it uses simh so can go on raspi and pidp-10'...! 
so i started looking more and more intently at that big pile of files there in the github repo - what you see in the root of the main branch is the starting point - simply a huge pile of files, unstructured, no signals what really matters and what not - 99.99% that this is exactly what merlyn got from harris around 2011, and what harris received as an email attachment in 1995 (what's there in the root has been debugged enough by merlyn, it was my starting point and was able to build and run it pretty quickly) 
now, here's the first exciting discovery - sometime last fall? 
first this one https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/utexas23-reconstruction/hlp/DECWAR.IMP - and then https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/utexas23-reconstruction/hlp/DECWAR.TAP and https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/utexas23-reconstruction/hlp/DECWAR.LTR 
Noah ‚Äî 07:13
as i studied these, there were the very first glimmers of 'project utexas'  in the old brain - 'ahha, there's deeper layers of archeology here!' üòç
this's how 'project utexas' and the concept of 'going backwards' were born - it's been a complete and total surprise, and has really evolved from zero - there was nothing this time last year - it took a loooooooong time for all the puzzle pieces to fit together and understandings to grow - latest big breakthroughs were very recent, april and early may, right around when eric and me first met! 
Noah ‚Äî 08:11
i'd say, fully formed concept was there around christmas - begin telling merlyn about it there over the holidays, and he was rightfully skeptical - call with merlyn in april was when flat out declared, it's happenin, and he blessed it all with 'will be happy to see it in action'. btw fwiw merlyn's working in the 'development' branch - that's where he has his 'cloaking device' code going. 
he's done really cool and fun stuff there - the way it works is, if you build on a planet, there's a probability your science officer will say 'sir, we've discovered an ancient ruin with cloaking technology' - you then get the ability to cloak

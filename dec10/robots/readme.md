# decwar robots

with project utexas 'booted from disk' and running in a terminal, open another terminal and do

    python robots/run.py --name robot1

if python complains about 'pexpect', then do a quick 'pip install pexpect'. open more terminals and run more robots using other names (robot2, robot3, etc).

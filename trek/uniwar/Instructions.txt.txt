Harris,

I just mailed you uuencoded, compressed cpio archives of the
daemon and handler.  You will want to do the following:

mkdir uniwardir	(or whatever)
cd uniwardir
mkdir daemon
mkdir handler

save the two uuencoded files as daemon/junk and handler/junk, then

cd daemon
uudecode junk
uncompress daemon.cpio
cpio -icdum <daemon.cpio
cd ../handler
uudecode junk
uncompress handler.cpio
cpio -icdum <handler.cpio

Next, edit daemon/config.h and handler/config.h to change GAMEDIR
to the full pathname of uniwardir.  Now you are ready to attempt a
build:

cd uniwardir/handler
make uniwar
cd ../daemon
make uniward
cd ..
make uscores

Finally, move uniwar and uniward to a directory that's in your path.


Good luck,

Bill

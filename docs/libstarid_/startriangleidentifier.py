class StartriangleIdentifier:
   '''identifies the target star of a star image, using the triangles formed by neighboring stars within the image. the fundemental particles are actually pairs of stars - in a sense individual stars don't exist here, what exists are pairs of stars, acting as sides of triangles. so a key object handed to the identifier in its constructor is a starpairs object, containing all of the relevant pairs.'''

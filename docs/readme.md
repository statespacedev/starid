# what's the idea?

we'd like to have three parallel and often independent workflows.

- cpp - pure cpp, cpp ide and tools, folder libstarid-debug

- py - pure py, py ide and tools, folder starid

- pyext - python extension in cpp, mixed mode py and cpp ide and tools, folder libstarid

# to do what?

- sky - generate three-dimensional sky models and two-dimensional images from the nasa skymap star catalog. finds stars near arbitrary points on the sky. generate 'old school mnist style' 28x28 images of target stars to pass onward to 'star identification'.

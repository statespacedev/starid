# what's the idea?

we'd like to have three parallel and sometimes independent workflows.

- cpp - pure cpp, cpp ide and tools, folder /libstarid-debug

- py - pure py, py ide and tools, folder /starid

- pyext - python extension in cpp, folder /libstarid

# to do what?

- sky - generate three-dimensional sky models and two-dimensional images from the nasa skymap star catalog. finds stars near arbitrary points on the sky.

# what are we doing?

we'd like to have three parallel and sometimes independent workflows.

- cpp - pure cpp, cpp ide and tools, basically the libstarid-debug folder

- py - pure py, py ide and tools, basically the starid folder

- ext - cpp extension for py, blend of the first two, basically the libstarid folder

# to do what?

- sky - generate three-dimensional sky models and two-dimensional images from the nasa skymap star catalog. finds stars near arbitrary points on the sky.

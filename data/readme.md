the foundation here is the nasa skymap star catalog.

this is an old catalog with a lot of history and quirks. back in the day, i interacted with some of the people involved and learned what i could.

there were roughly two phases of skymap's history - before hubble, and after. the launch of hubble was the key event. nasa still had some power in those days and when it turned out that star catalogs were one of hubble's problems, resources were allocated to improve the skymap catalog. serious work was done in the 90s to make skymap the reference catalog for spacecraft star trackers.

what's the minimum tape writing for algebra.map?

be able to write to floats per tape record/line

# test2a.map, writing to tape, begin exps with macros

why can't there be blank lines/cards?

why does the channel command ioct need to be after it is used?

why does macro def need to be before use?

# test2b.map, extend exps with macros

able to write alphameric literal to tape

# test2c.map
